## Features  

- Simulates a single-player blackjack game against a computer dealer.  
- Basic blackjack rules implemented:
  - Automatic "Blackjack" recognition.  
  - Handling of Ace as 1 or 11 based on the current hand.  
  - Dealer logic to stop drawing at 17 or higher.  
- Interactive prompts for player decisions.  
- Randomized card draws for a fair game.  

---

## Rules  

1. **Objective:** Get closer to 21 than the dealer without exceeding 21.  
2. **Card Values:** 
   - Number cards are worth their face value.  
   - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10.  
   - Aces can count as 1 or 11.  
3. **Gameplay:**  
   - Player starts with two cards, and the dealer gets two cards (one hidden).  
   - The player can "hit" to draw additional cards or "stand" to keep their hand.  
   - If either the player or dealer exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose.  
   - The dealer draws until reaching at least 17.
